Medical Cost Prediction | Multiple Linear Regression | Self Project                                                     [Sept-Nov 2022]
	Performed EDA to understand the distribution of the features, and checked for missing and duplicate values
	 Converted categorical variables into numerical data & distributed the data set into a training & testing set
	Fitted the linear regression model to the data using the Scikit-learn library & achieved an adjusted R2 of74.4%
	Used the trained model to make predictions on new data and visualized the predicted medical cost of trained and tested data set to understand how well the model is performing
